You can configure a GitHub Actions workflow to be triggered when an event occurs in your repository, 
    such as a pull request being opened or an issue being created.

Your workflow contains one or more jobs which can run in sequential order or in parallel.

Each job will run inside its own virtual machine runner, or inside a container.

Workflows are defined in the .github/workflows directory in a repository, and a repository can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.
    For example, you can have one workflow to build and test pull requests
    another workflow to deploy your application every time a release is created
    and still another workflow that adds a label every time someone opens a new issue.

An event is a specific activity in a repository that triggers a workflow run. (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows)

A job is a set of steps in a workflow that is executed on the same runner.

A runner is a server that runs your workflows when they're triggered.

Each runner can run a single job at a time.

GitHub provides Ubuntu Linux, Microsoft Windows, and macOS runners to run your workflows; each workflow run executes in a fresh, newly-provisioned virtual machine.
